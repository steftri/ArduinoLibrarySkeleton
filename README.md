Skeleton for Arduino library


## General

The skeleton serves as a template for an arduino library.  


## Features

* Basic arduino library file structure
* Basic arduino class methods ('begin' and 'end' as well as an example getter and setter) 
* platformIO [development respository](https://github.com/steftri/ArduinoLibrarySkeleton_dev) with 
  * unit and integration tests based on 'Unity' and 'GoogleTest'
  * Doxygen support
  * support of native platform, ATmega (Arduino UNO, Arduino Mega5120), ESP8266/ESP32 and STM32 (BluePill, BlackPill)
